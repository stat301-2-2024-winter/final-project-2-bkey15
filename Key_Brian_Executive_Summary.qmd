## Purpose of Project

Two of my three dissertation chapters rely on the use of a dependent variable measuring human rights respect. Hitherto, I have depended on [Fariss's Human Rights (HR) Scores](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/HumanRightsScores), but he has not updated his dataset since 2020. This poses a problem insofar as it excludes the most recent country-year observations from my universe of cases entirely.

In my [previous final project](https://github.com/stat301-1-2023-fall/final-project-1-bkey15), and by way of exploratory data analyses (EDAs), I identified a "raw" form of the physical violence index (PVI)---a simple average of the freedoms from political killings and torture indicators featured in the [Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) dataset](https://v-dem.net/)---as a potential substitute for HR scores. However, for this project, I aim to predict outright the missing data in HR scores whilst more formally appraising the suitability of the raw PVI as a simple substitute for HR scores.

## Structure of Report

My final report proceeds in the following steps. First, I give an overview of HR scores and V-Dem, additionally conducting a brief EDA on the former. Next, I summarize my pre-recipe preprocessing and describe the recipes themselves. I then furnish and discuss the results of my baseline, tuned, and final fits. Finally, I examine time-series estimates of HR scores and compare these predictions to those generated by my final model. The report also contains a short appendix.

## Key Findings

My main findings are:

1. There exist more accurate ways to approximate HR scores than to use the raw PVI in lieu of it.
2. Of these, the best-performing is a KNN-regression model.
3. Time-series models exhibit even lower mean prediction errors, yet evidence suggests they may feature greater variance vis-Ã -vis the KNN model.

## Main Visuals

The report's most significant plot is @fig-hr-preds, below, which demonstrates the tight fit---and hence high degree of accuracy---of the final KNN-regression model:

Also important is @fig-ts-knn-dens, below: it not only suggests a memorization of the original data by the time-series models,^[More precisely, because the distribution of the time-series predictions is highly similar to that of the original HR-scores data. This is explained in greater detail in the report.] but also comports with [Fariss's (2014) finding](http://cfariss.com/documents/Fariss2014APSR.pdf) that human rights respect is improving over time. It therefore helps inform my third key finding, above.
